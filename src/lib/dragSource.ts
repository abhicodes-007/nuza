/**
 * What is being dragged in the file tree, and which row the pointer is over.
 *
 * Module state rather than React state, for two reasons.
 *
 * A drag that starts in the sidebar and ends in the editor crosses from React
 * into CodeMirror, and the two only meet at the module level. The obvious
 * alternative - hanging the path off the drag's `DataTransfer` - cannot be read
 * back during `dragover`, which is exactly when the editor has to decide
 * whether it is willing to take the drop.
 *
 * And `dragover` fires on every pointer move. While these two paths were React
 * state on the sidebar, each of those frames re-rendered the panel, which built
 * a new tree context, which re-rendered every row in the vault - thousands of
 * components per animation frame to move one highlight. Here, a row subscribes
 * to the one question it actually asks - am I the row being dragged, am I the
 * row under the pointer - so a frame re-renders the two rows whose answer just
 * changed and nothing else.
