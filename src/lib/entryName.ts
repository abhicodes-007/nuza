/**
 * What a file or folder in the vault is allowed to be called.
 *
 * The inline row in the sidebar used to hand whatever was typed straight to
 * `create_file` and `rename_entry`, which joined it onto the parent path: a
 * name of `../../notes.md` wrote a file outside the vault, and the row the
 * sidebar then held pointed somewhere the tree could not show, so the file
 * vanished until the next restart. The backend refuses those now, but a
 * refusal arriving as a notice after the row has closed is a poor way to
 * learn that a slash is not allowed - so the same rules are checked here,
 * while the name is still being typed and can still be corrected.
 *
 * Windows' rules are applied everywhere, not only on Windows. A vault is very
 * often a synced folder, and a note called `aux.md` or `report.` is one that
 * cannot be checked out on a machine that is not this one - being told about
 * it here is better than the vault breaking on someone else's laptop.
