//! What the open vault holds, kept in memory.
//!
//! Quick-open, the content search, the tags and the backlinks all need to know
//! which notes there are, and the last three need what is in them. Each of them
//! used to walk the vault and read every note from scratch on every request,
//! which is a cost that grows with the vault and is paid again on each
//! keystroke that ends in a pause.
//!
//! The index is built once when a folder is opened, off the thread that opens
//! it, and then patched as the filesystem watcher reports changes - so what it
//! holds is a picture of the vault that is kept current rather than taken
//! again. A note's text is read the first time something asks for it and kept
//! until the note changes, so a vault that is never searched never has its
//! notes read.
